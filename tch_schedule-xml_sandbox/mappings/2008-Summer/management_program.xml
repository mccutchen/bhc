For advisement, call the faculty members: Mary Lou Avera, 972-860-4179, marylou@dcccd.edu;  or Marisa Walsdorf, 972-860-4186, marisa_walsdorf@dcccd.edu.  Minimum requirements for enrollment:  a student must be currently employed in an appropriate job and meet the TSI requirements in reading and writing.  Credits are earned in a traditional on-campus course and in an on-the-job, cooperative education training course.  There are no course prerequisites, but students may enroll in only one co-op ed course per semester.  It is strongly recommended that interested students contact a faculty member before classes begin.
