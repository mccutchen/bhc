			<h1>AMERICA AT THE CROSSROADS</h1>
			<p>The coordinated studies courses meet Monday through Thursday from 9-11:50 a.m. in Room T303</p>
			<p>The program is a 12-credit-hour block of choices from <b>CORE CURRICULUM COURSES</b>, interrelated by the theme <b>"America at the Crossroads."</b>  </p>
