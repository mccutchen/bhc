			<h1>AMERICA AT THE CROSSROADS</h1>
			<p>The coordinated studies courses meet Monday through Thursday from 9-11:50 a.m.</p><!--  in Room XXX. -->
			<p>The program is a 12-credit-hour block of choices from <b>CORE CURRICULUM COURSES</b>, interrelated by the theme <b>"America at the Crossroads."</b>  </p>

This learning community emphasizes interactive learning activities, community building and team work.  Through coordinating ideas students will develop critical thinking skills.  This program includes readings from popular sources.  The four program professors together meet with the entire group daily, so student-teacher interaction is enhanced. </p>
