See Commencement 2007

Though not everyone at the college interacts with students on a daily basis, everyone can take pride in the accomplishments of students on a special day like Commencement.  This year, hundreds of students celebrated with family, friends and the college, as they crossed the stage to receive their congratulations and diplomas or certificates.

Congratulations also go to some of our Brookhaven brethren who took those same steps as well.  <b>Christine Broadus</b> and <b>Milan McGowan</b> earned Associate of Arts degrees.  <b>Maribel Pullen</b> completed her Associate of Science degree.


This year’s Minnie Stevens Piper Nominee, <b>Cynthia Mills</b>, delivered the commencement address, after a welcome from president, Dr. <b>Sharon L. Blackman</b> and greetings from trustee <b>Bob Ferguson</b>.  Music from the Faculty and Student Orchestra as well as the Vocal Jazz Ensemble rounded out much of the evening’s celebrations. 

If you weren’t able to attend, these photos can offer a sense of the event and of our student’s celebration.
