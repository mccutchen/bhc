<i>Fort Worth Weekly</i> Features Book Buy-Back Perspectives from Brookhaven Student and Faculty

The latest edition of the <i>Fort Worth Weekly</i> includes an article focusing on the continuing battle students face in affording and re-selling textbooks.  “Buy-Back Blues,” features the comments of several college students, including Lauri Wiss, a Brookhaven College student, who has lobbied in Austin for legislation that would prevent publishers from updating textbook editions more than once every three years.  Wiss has also gathered signatures at the college on a petition to ask that students be given a textbook “tax holiday” like the one that is available for the purchase of clothes and supplies for students each August.  

The article addresses how publishers “update” textbooks for new editions with very few additions or changes.  In addition it talks to professors about the role they play in the process in the books that they select for their courses.  <b>Haven Abedin</b>, English professor, talked to the reporter, I’sha Gaines, about setting up ways to use the same textbook for successive courses.
