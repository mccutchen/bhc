Sharon’s Corner

On Thursday, May 10, 2007, more than 180 Brookhaven College graduates celebrated their accomplishment of earning an associate degree or certificate.  In attendance were the graduates’ family members, friends and co-workers who came to honor their achievements.  Once again, thanks to all of you who helped to make this graduation exercise a special occasion for our graduates and their families and supporters.  Very special thanks go to <b>Stephen Roberts</b>, student speaker, <b>Christina Garza</b>, student invocation presenter, and <b>Bob Ferguson</b>, DCCCD Board Trustee.   

The end of the spring semester and the beginning of the summer terms are very special times of the year.  Student graduates are ending one chapter of their lives while beginning another.  Employees begin to experience closure of an academic year, while beginning the rejuvenation process and preparation for the beginning of another year.   The summer is often seen as a transitional period and this year is no different.

Dr. <b>Claude Caffee</b>, vice president for student development, will retire effective Aug. 31.  He has contributed more than 25 years of service to Brookhaven College.  He is a highly respected leader and student advocate.  We will begin the search process for the position of vice president of enrollment services and student success with a vacancy notice that will be advertised this summer.  A search committee consisting of staff members, students and faculty will be chaired by <b>Brenda Dalton</b>, director of advising and Texas Success Initiative.  The committee will begin its work in early September and will conclude its work with a recommendation to the DCCCD Board of Trustees no later than December.  Dr. Caffee has agreed to assist the college with the transition by working part time until the search is concluded in December.  

Dr. <b>Derek Mpinga</b>, vice president of instruction, has accepted another position and submitted his resignation effective June 30.  We thank him for his dedication and commitment to education and wish him much success with his new position.  Dr. <b>Richard McCrary</b>, associate vice chancellor for educational affairs for academic programs, has agreed to serve as Brookhaven College’s interim vice president of learning and student success, beginning July 1, as we make the transition in our instructional area. Dr. McCrary has held a variety of positions in the DCCCD over the last 35 years: counselor, instructor, director of counseling, and a number of positions at the District Office including his present position of associate vice chancellor of educational affairs for academic programs.  During his District Office tenure, he has served as an interim vice president at Cedar Valley, Mountain View, and Richland colleges.  In addition, he served for a year as the interim vice chancellor of educational affairs.  He holds a B.S. and M.Ed. from East Texas State University, now Texas A&M at Commerce, an Ed.D. in community college education from Nova Southeastern University, and has additional graduate work at the University of Alabama, the University of Illinois, and The Ohio State University.  Dr. McCrary has extensive experience in providing leadership to a number of districtwide initiatives and is exceedingly familiar with curriculum issues impacting the DCCCD. We look forward to Dr. McCrary joining our team as we continue to strengthen our instructional area based on the learning college concept.

Other transitions occurring this summer include welcoming new faculty joining our “family” in the fall semester.  New faculty beginning with the fall 2007 semester, contingent on Board approval, include <b>Jim Dudlo</b>, history; <b>Melody Gamblin-Bullock</b>, music, and <b>Geoffrey Saari</b>, English.  Other faculty positions approved in the Planning and Budget process include two visiting scholar positions in English and child development.

As usual, Brookhaven continues to excel in many venues.

Once again, thanks goes to everyone who participated in the trivia games to support the textbook fund.  A special thanks to organizer <b>Nita Drescher</b>; quiz developer <b>Terri Edrich</b> and all the volunteers who helped make the day a big success.  The $1,500 collected will help many students with book support as they strive to make their dream a reality.

Several weeks ago I asked for volunteers to serve on the Brookhaven College Quality Enhancement Plan, QEP, team.  Although we had some volunteers, it is important that we assemble the best group that will lead the topic selection and development of the plan that will be submitted to SACS.  Thank you to all that have taken an interest with this plan.  An announcement regarding the committee members will be coming soon.  

With spring showers come May flowers; may your flowers bloom and bring you much joy as we begin our summer season!
