            <h1>AMERICA AT THE CROSSROADS</h1>
            <p>The coordinated studies courses meet Monday through Thursday from 9-11:50 a.m. in Room T303</p>
            <p>The program is a 12-credit-hour block of choices from <b>CORE CURRICULUM COURSES</b>, interrelated by the theme <b>"America at the Crossroads."</b>  </p>

This learning community emphasizes interactive learning activities, community building and team work.  Through coordinating ideas students will develop critical thinking skills.  This program includes readings from popular sources.  The four program professors together meet with the entire group daily, so student-teacher interaction is enhanced. </p>
            <p>Enrollment is limited to 90 students, so a true learning community is formed.  </p>
            <p><b>To register for the Coordinated Studies Program, see an advisor in the Brookhaven College Advising and Counseling Center, Bldg. S, Room S113.</b></p>
