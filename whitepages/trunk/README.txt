Uses the employees Access database maintained by Stephanie and Meridith to
generate a staff directory for the Employee Intranet.

Note: This software is no longer actively maintained. It works, but it has not
been updated in some time.

Requirements: I'm can't remember exactly which Python modules are required.
Off the top of my head, at least the following modules are required.
 * Pyana (http://pyana.sourceforge.net/)
 * mxODBC (http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBC/)

Good luck!
